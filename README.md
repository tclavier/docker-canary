# docker-scriptcraft

It's a [Docker](http://www.docker.com) container for [minecraft]() with
[SigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and [ScriptCraft](http://scriptcraftjs.org/)
installed and ready to run.

ScriptCraft is a Minecraft Mod that lets you extend Minecraft using the Javascript Programming Language. ScriptCraft makes modding Minecraft easier. It includes a logo-like "Drone" object that can be used to build complex buildings, roads, villages, even entire cities. It also includes many other features that make modding Minecraft easier.

# Run

To run it launch :

    docker run -p 25565:25565 -p 22:22 -it tclavier/scriptcraft

# Play

To test connect your minecraft client to `minecraft.tcweb.org` and read https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/API-Reference.md

# Options

Some options could be pass by environment variables :

* `OPS` : Pseudo of first ops
* `INIT_WORLD` : if this variable is set, all worlds will be removed at startup
* `ONLINE_MODE` : true or false, option to enable account verification

I have enabled a volume: /minecraft, to persist world

For exemple : 

    docker run -p 25565:25565 -it -e OPS=FooBar -e ONLINE_MODE=false -v minecraft:/minecraft tclavier/scriptcraft
